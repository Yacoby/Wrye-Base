**TODO**
Balt has in most cases been moved to wryebase/gui

Things such as IdList, which have no wx dependacy have moved elsewhere


==bolt==
WryeText has moved to its own module (wtex). bolt is still used to generate it
due to the dependcy on mainfunc

Path functions have moved to their own module (path)

Localization has moved to its own module (localization)

bUseUnicode has moved to its own module (conf). This in theory allows for
changing of the variable at runtime, however this may not work. So set it
to the required value at startup
