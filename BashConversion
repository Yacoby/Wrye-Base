====Planned Structure====

wryebase\
  gui\              everything to do with the user bash interface that is
                    game indepndant. much of this comes from balt.py and
                    basher.py

    __init__.py     core utility functions/classes
    mod.py          mod panel
    ini.py          ini panel

  struct\           custom data structures. all will be imported into struct
                    although they may exist in deperate files (to help version
                    control/show depenancies) Much of this code comes from
                    bolt.py

    __init__.py     imports all other files in this directory so you 
                    only need to import struct for ease of use
                    
    table.py        This would contain the table strucure. This would not
                    need to be imported as it is imported into struct (so
                    you just need to import struct)

  wizard/           Abstract from belt.py, 


==basher==
**TODO**
Moved dialog pannels to 

==balt==
**TODO**
Balt has in most cases been moved to wryebase/gui

Things such as IdList, which have no wx dependacy have moved elsewhere


==bolt==
WryeText has moved to its own module (wtex). bolt is still used to generate it
due to the dependcy on mainfunc

Path functions have moved to their own module (path)

Localization has moved to its own module (localization)

bUseUnicode has moved to its own module (conf). This in theory allows for
changing of the variable at runtime, however this may not work. So set it
to the required value at startup
