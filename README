This is an attempt to refactor some of Wrye Bash out of Wrye Bash and into a 
seperate library. This should allow more programs, such as Wrye Mash to take
advantage of changes to Wrye Bash.

It also has the advantage of fixing some of the problems in the code base
with Wrye Bash as well as trying to seperate some of the code as dependancies
become more visible.
